# Bikesharing Analysis
### Project Overview
This is an analysis of NYC Bike Sharing showing the different relationships between users, weekdays, time and gender of users. As this business has shown its success in NYC, we want to show this statistical analysis to potential investors to launch a similar enterprise in Des Moines. 

### Results
We can see on the graph below the checkout times for all users.

We've then broken down these numbers by gender:

It is also important to show the number of trips by weekday per hour to see when this bikesharing system is mostly used:

We also wanted to break down these results by gender as seen below.

Finally, we wanted to make a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each usertype.

### Summary
After reviewing the data, it seems like launching a bike-sharing business in any major city would be a success. And the environment will benefit from this project too! 
We hope this convince some potential investors and are available for further discussion.
